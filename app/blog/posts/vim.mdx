# Serverless Video Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
Designed an event-driven pipeline where S3 uploads trigger Lambda functions for frame extraction (via FFmpeg) and subsequent face recognition processing running in container images.

## Technologies Used
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon S3
- FFmpeg
- OpenCV
- Container Images
- Python

## Implementation Details
The pipeline follows a serverless architecture pattern:
1. Videos are uploaded to an S3 bucket
2. Upload events trigger a Lambda function for initial processing
3. The Lambda function extracts frames using FFmpeg
4. A second Lambda function (running in a container) performs face recognition
5. Results are stored back in S3

## Optimization Strategies
- Optimized Lambda container size to less than 1GB by using `python:3.8-slim`
- Externalized model weights to S3 for faster loading
- Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce cold starts by 45%
- Achieved end-to-end processing of 100 videos in 300 seconds

## Benefits of Serverless Approach
- **Zero Maintenance**: No server management required
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling to match incoming workload
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for actual execution time
- **Simplicity**: Focus on application logic instead of infrastructure

## Skills Demonstrated
- Serverless Architecture Design
- Container Optimization
- Event-driven Programming
- Cloud-native Development
- Video Processing Pipelines
