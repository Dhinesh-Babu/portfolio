# Multi-Tier Elastic Face Recognition Application

## Overview
Architected a three-tier system (Web, App, Data) on EC2 with custom auto-scaling capabilities, dynamically scaling the App Tier from 0 to 20 instances based on SQS queue length, processing 100 concurrent requests in less than 80 seconds.

## Technologies Used
- AWS (EC2, Auto Scaling, Elastic IP, SQS, S3)
- Docker
- Deep Learning
- Python
- ResNet-34

## Implementation Details
The application implements a three-tier architecture:
- **Web Tier**: Handles incoming requests and pushes them to SQS for processing
- **App Tier**: Implements auto-scaling based on queue length, performing face recognition using a pre-loaded ResNet-34 model
- **Data Tier**: Uses S3 for durable storage of images and recognition results

## Performance Optimization
Pre-baked a custom AMI with a pre-loaded ResNet-34 model to reduce cold-start time by 60%, ensuring near-instantaneous processing during scale-out events.

## Architecture Strengths
- **Scalability**: Handles variable workloads efficiently by scaling from 0 to 20 instances
- **Fault Tolerance**: Message-driven communication with durable storage prevents data loss
- **Cost Efficiency**: Scale-to-zero capability reduces costs during idle periods
- **Performance**: Optimized for quick response times even under heavy load
