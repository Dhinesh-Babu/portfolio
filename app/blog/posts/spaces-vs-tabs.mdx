# Digieye: Android App for the Visually Impaired

## Overview
Designed a Visual Question Answering (VQA) system for blind and low-vision users, building an Android application integrated with Vertex AI APIs and NLP for seamless image-based queries.

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- Python
- FastAPI
- Vertex AI
- Google Cloud Platform

## Implementation Details
The application uses camera features to capture and save pictures, then makes a POST request to a FastAPI server connected to the Vertex AI backend. The FastAPI server sends a compressed photo to Vertex AI, gets the answer, and replies back to the phone. The phone then uses text-to-speech to convey the information to the user.

## Impact
Boosted accessibility by achieving 90% average response accuracy in real-world testing, offering immediate interpretation of images in everyday scenarios for visually impaired users.

## Key Challenges
- Optimizing the image compression pipeline for faster response times
- Balancing AI model accuracy with mobile performance constraints
- Designing an intuitive interface for visually impaired users

## Skills Demonstrated
- Android Development
- API Integration
- Machine Learning Application
- Accessibility Design
- Cloud Services
