# Hello World

Welcome to my first blog post! I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology, programming, and my journey as a software engineer.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- Cloud Technologies and infrastructure optimization
- DevOps best practices and automation strategies
- Kubernetes and containerization techniques
- Software architecture patterns for scalable applications
- My professional journey and lessons learned

## My Background

As a Software Engineer with expertise in DevOps and cloud technologies, I've worked on designing and implementing scalable solutions using Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure. During my time at Affinsys AI, I focused on:

- Building secure CI/CD pipelines with integrated security scans
- Designing microservice architectures on Kubernetes
- Implementing high-availability solutions for critical systems
- Engineering observability platforms for improved system monitoring

I'm also pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Arizona State University, focusing on cloud computing and software security.

## Recent Projects

I've been working on several interesting projects recently:

1. **Digieye** - An Android application with Visual Question Answering for blind and low-vision users
2. **Multi-Tier Elastic Face Recognition** - A scalable cloud-based solution built on AWS
3. **Serverless Video Analysis Pipeline** - An event-driven pipeline using AWS Lambda for efficient video processing

Stay tuned for detailed articles about these projects and more technical content!
